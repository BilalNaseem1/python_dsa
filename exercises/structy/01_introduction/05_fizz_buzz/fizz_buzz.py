# Write a function, fizz_buzz, that takes in a number n as an argument. 
# The function should return a list containing numbers from 1 to n, 
# replacing certain numbers according to the following rules:

#     if the number is divisible by 3, make the element "fizz"
#     if the number is divisible by 5, make the element "buzz"
#     if the number is divisible by 3 and 5, make the element "fizzbuzz"


def fizz_buzz(n):
    output = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i %3==0 and i % 5==0:
            output.append("fizzbuzz")

        elif i%3 ==0:
            output.append("fizz")
        elif i%5 == 0:
            output.append("buzz")

        else:
            output.append(i)

    return output
